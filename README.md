# chromium-extension-msdocs-easy-switch-lang
Easy switch lang button on msdocs for Chromium (Chrome and Edge).

## Description
Are you an avid reader of Microsoft Docs eager to get it in English as well as in your mother tongue version?
<br>But changing URLs manually is a bit tedious, no?

With this extension you can switch between your language and English in one click!
<br>From the upper right Extensions button, display "MSDocs Easy Switch Lang" and click on it with [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/) open.
<br>This extension will work to switch between the UI language set in your browser and English.
<br>If English is set as the UI language, your browser's list of allowed languages will appear in order.


## Example
With the English document displayed, click the button:

It will then switch to the Japanese document:
